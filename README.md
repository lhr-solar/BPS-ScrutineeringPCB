# BPS Scrutineering PCB

## Purpose
This board is placed in between the batteries and the [Minion Boards](https://github.com/lhr-solar/BPS-MinionPCB) to allow for scrutineering. In order to use this board properly, you must turn off one switch on the board, apply a voltage between the testpoint for that connection and the one above or below it, and see if the BPS trips. PTC fuses are added to ensure that the Minions Boards are not damaged in case the user does not properly turn off the switch or mishandles the board.

## Connectors
* Four 7 Pin Connectors for feeding voltage measurements
